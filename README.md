Health-monitoring
=================

One point monitoring of health

This project was created to make free every day carry health monitor.

This device include few parts:

1. Sensors
1.1 Sensors of health
1.2 Environmental sensors

Part 2. GPS/GLONASS

Part 3. Free energy



At firs we used Arduino controler (Meag8), but letter code will be ported in STM32 or others low-enegy controllers.

1.1 Sensor of Health

1.1.1 Sensor of temperature

1.1.2 Sensor of pulse (pulsoximeter, health rate monitor, pulsometr)

1.1.3 Sensor of skine resistance

1.1.4 Humidity sensor



1.2 Environmental sensors

1.2.1 Sensor of temperature

1.2.2 Humidity sensor

1.2.3 Radiation sensor

1.2.4
